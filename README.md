# Weather-Forecast
This is a weather forecast of cities worldwide, made by FLASK and PYTHON.

We have a folder with some other files/folders inside. We actually need an app.py file, a templates folder with the idex file in it, a static forlder with the style file in it and the venv folder because we need a virtual environment to run the app.

Also we need to make an account free in "https://home.openweathermap.org/" and make an API Key so to use it.

CAUTION: The API Key need some minutes to hours to activate. Until then you can not run the app. Actually it will run but it will not saw you anything in return.
